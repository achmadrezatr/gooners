          <h2>Arsenal F.C</h2>
          <p>
            Arsenal Football Club is an English professional football club based
            in Islington, London. Arsenal plays in the Premier League, the top
            flight of English football. The club has won 13 league titles
            (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League
            Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup, and
            one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the
            third-most successful club in English football. Arsenal was the
            first club from the South of England to join the Football League in
            1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only
            once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division,
            and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football
            history.In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two
            FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In
            1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989
            and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including
            two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest
            average league position. Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified
            for the UEFA Champions League for nineteen consecutive seasons.
            Herbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won
            the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to
            dominate the 1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in
            1934, aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights,
            and shirt numbers; he also added the white sleeves and brighter red
            to the club's jersey. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager
            and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his
            title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight
            unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the
            nickname The Invincibles. In 1886, munitions workers at the Royal
            Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913 the
            club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close
            neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London
            derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an
            annual revenue of £340.3m in the 2019–20 season, Arsenal was
            estimated to be worth US$2.68 billion by Forbes, making it the
            world's eighth most valuable club, while it is one of the most
            followed on social media. The motto of the club has long been
            Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for "Victory Through Harmony".

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            In October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions
            workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a
            workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member
            contributed sixpence and Danskin also added three shillings to help
            form the club.Dial Square played their first match on 11 December
            1886 against Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0. The club renamed to
            Royal Arsenal a month later, and its first home was Plumstead
            Common, though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor
            Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London
            Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these
            were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their
            time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first
            London club to turn professional. Royal Arsenal renamed for a second
            time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They
            registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football
            League when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was
            the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in
            the Second Division and reaching the First Division in 1904. Falling
            attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions
            workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere
            in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen
            Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and
            sought to move them elsewhere. In 1913, soon after relegation back
            to the Second Division, the club moved across the river to the new
            Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. In 1919, The Football League
            controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated
            local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First
            Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division's last
            pre-war season of 1914–15. Later that year, The Arsenal started
            dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name
            for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.

              Before joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on
              Plumstead Common, then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, then
              spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta
              Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club
              returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing,
              upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their
              home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in
              the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.

            <h3>Highbury</h3>
            <img src="../img/highbury.jpg" alt="" class="gambar" />
            <p>
              Highbury, Arsenal Stadium was the club's home from September 1913
              until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned
              football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to
              many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered
              stand and three open-air banks of terracing.[28] The entire
              stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco
              West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936
              respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace,
              which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored
              until 1954.[28] Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at
              its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The
              Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to
              convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94
              season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated
              spectators.[119] This capacity had to be reduced further during
              Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising
              boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000,
              Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which
              could house more than 70,000 spectators.[120]

            <h3>Emirates stadium</h3>
            <img src="../img/emirates.jpg" alt="" srcset="" class="gambar" />
            <p>
              After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed
              building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since
              named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of
              Highbury.[122] The project was initially delayed by red tape and
              rising costs,[123] and construction was completed in July 2006, in
              time for the start of the 2006–07 season.[124] The stadium was
              named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom
              the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football
              history, worth around £100 million.[125] Some fans referred to the
              ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree
              with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.[126] The stadium will
              be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and
              the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until at least
              2024.[127][128] From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the
              stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank,
              East Stand, West Stand and Clock end.[129] The capacity of the
              Emirates now stands at 60,704.[130]
